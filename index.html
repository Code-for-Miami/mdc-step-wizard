						<p>Ok! We've verified that you <b>do</b> need a Short-Term Events Permit (STEP).</p>
						
						<p>You’ll need a Short-Term Events Permit if your event is open to the public and if your event has temporary structures, including tents (above a 10' x 12' threshold), bleachers, stages, specialty wiring, rides, lifts, and ramps, non-portable ventilation systems or enclosed cooking facilities.</p>

						Do you plan on having more than 300 people inside a temporary tent? All temporary tents with more than 300 occupants require Miami-Dade Fire Rescue’s Fire Watch (MDFR) present for the duration of the event. Fire Watch can be set up by calling MDFR Special Events at (786) 331-4438.

9101 N.W. 25th Street, (305) 471-2800

Will you be holding the event at a county park? A County park requires insurance if you’re hosting an event with temporary structures. Contact the park directly - a representative from Miami-Dade Parks department will send you to the places where forms are required.

What documents do I need before starting the Short-Term Events Permit process?

[FIXME] How many days in advance should you start preparing the packet and submit the permitting application? 

Provide a letter from the “event holder” containing a summary of what the event is and when the events are going to take place. This will be presented to the Regulatory and Economic Resources (RER) Department as part of a packet.

The “event holder” is the person responsible for the event in its entirety. This can be the property owner, the planner of the event, or another party.

Produce two professionally drawn and detailed plans of the event space, done by a licensed professional. The plans will be used by MDFR and RER departments and should include the following: 
Temporary and permanent structures
Detailed floor plans of the insides of structures, including where catering will be set up and where electrical will need to run
Parking and setbacks 



Complete the five page Professional Certification for Short Term Event Affidavit and Verification Form. You’ll need the signatures of the property owner, event holder, lead contractor,  electrical, plumbing, and mechanical contractors as well as the signature and seal of a Florida licensed and registered architect or engineer who will be responsible for performing plan reviews and inspections for Florida Building Code requirements.

How do I get a Short-Term Events Permit?
How do I submit my event?

You should have a packet of the following: the Short Term Event Affidavit, two floor plans, a letter from the event holder as well as any necessary signatures from nearby homeowners, if applicable.

Submit the packet to the Miami-Dade County Permitting and Inspection Center (PIC).
Pay a starting processing fee of $72, along with $71.50 for fire, and $51.50 for zoning. 
You’ll receive a process number (a “C” number). That completes the affidavit check and the form goes to  planning & zoning. 


What happens after I submit the paperwork?

The RER department will review the neighborhood signatures and affidavit, and the Planning & Zoning division will review the plans to verify proper zoning.
RER will also examine the building plans to ensure everything is up to code.
The forms and plans will automatically be routed to Miami-Dade Fire Rescue (MDFR) for an on-site inspection. MDFR will do the following:

Charge additional fees, varying by the amount of structures in the plans. For example: 1 tent is $75. A recent tennis tournament for example had around $7,000 in fees.

Determine if the event requires Fire Watch (for example, if pyrotechnics are involved). 
Notify the police, who will review the plans and event details and determine if police are required. MDPD can also recommend against MDFR approving an event in certain circumstances, in which case MDFR will deny the permit.. 

Approve or deny the permit.

After the RER department gives a final affidavit check, the additional fees are calculated and a permit will be issued. 

What happens after I get the permit?

Once you have the permit, you’re okay to set up the temporary structures for your event. 
When the event space is completely set up, an inspector from MDFR will coordinate with the event holder to visit the site - the event holder does not need to set up an appointment.
Event holders have generally tried to have their sites ready for inspection ahead of the weekend, as Saturday and Sunday inspections trigger overtime for the inspectors - and higher fees for the customer.
You will have the clearance to host the event once it has passed MDFR inspection. The permit is a printed card displaying the permit number and should be posted at the site of the event.

What happens when I’m done with my event?

An opened permit will need to be closed after the event.
When the event is over and ten days have elapsed, a RER inspector will visit the site to make sure all temporary structures have been removed and the site has been restored to original condition.
If this inspection passes, the permit is closed, and you’re done!
If this inspection fails, the Event Holder will need to come into compliance and be re-inspected, or violations may be filed and fines incurred.
